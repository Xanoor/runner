# Runner 🎯

Runner is a personal project designed to track the total runtime of specific processes on your system. Built as an Electron application with a Python Flask backend, it records and logs process usage durations.

**Note:** This project is a personal experiment and is not meant for commercial use or as a polished release.

---

## Features ✨

-   Tracks the total runtime of selected processes & timeframes.
-   Allows users to add, remove, and manage processes.
-   Logs process activity and saves data locally.
-   Provides a periodic data update mechanism.

## Installation 🛠️

-   [Node.js](https://nodejs.org/) (for running Electron)
-   [Python 3.x](https://www.python.org/) (for the Flask backend)

1. Clone the repository:

```bash
git clone https://github.com/Xanoor/runner.git
cd runner
```

2. Install the Node.js dependencies and the required Python libraries with:

```bash
npm install
```

```bash
pip install flask psutil
```

-   Ensure the required Python libraries are installed.

## Usage 🚀

> ⚠️ Since an executable file (`backend.exe`) for the Flask backend is not provided in the code (`const backendPath = path.join(process.resourcesPath, "app", "src", "backend", "backend.exe");`), you may encounter an error in the console related to the backend executable when launching the app. **This error can be safely ignored**, as the Flask server is started separately in step 1.

1. Start the Flask backend:

```bash
python backend/main.py
```

2. Start the Electron app:

```bash
npm start
```

3. Ensure the following data files are created in `%APPDATA%/RunnerApp/data` (Windows) or `~/.local/share/RunnerApp/data` (Linux/Mac):

    - `runtime.runr`
    - `apps.json`
    - `logs.txt`

    The application automatically initializes these files if they don’t exist.

## Data Storage 💾

The following files are saved in `%APPDATA%/RunnerApp/data` (Windows) or `~/.local/share/RunnerApp/data` (Linux/Mac):

-   **`runtime.runr`**: Stores process runtime data.
-   **`apps.json`**: Contains the list of processes to track.
-   **`logs.txt`**: Logs events and activities.
